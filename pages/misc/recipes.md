Perfect ðŸ‘Œ glad you liked the first set. Hereâ€™s **another balanced Indian vegan menu** (same structure: 2 mains, 2 dry veg sides, 2 extras), but with different dishes so you can swap or mix between the two lists.

---

### Person A (Hearty mains)

1. **Rajma Masala (Kidney Bean Curry)**

   * Kidney beans cooked in a rich tomatoâ€“onionâ€“gingerâ€“garlic base with garam masala.
   * Hearty, a North Indian classic, great with rice.

2. **Vegetable Korma (Cashewâ€“Coconut Curry)**

   * Mixed veggies (beans, carrots, peas, potato) in a mildly spiced, creamy cashewâ€“coconut sauce.
   * Less heat, slightly sweet, balances the spread.

---

### Person B (Dry vegetable dishes)

3. **Cabbage Thoran (South Indian Cabbage Stir-fry)**

   * Finely shredded cabbage with grated coconut, mustard seeds, curry leaves, and green chilies.
   * Light, fresh, and different from the heavier dishes.

4. **Methi Aloo (Potato with Fenugreek Leaves)**

   * Potatoes sautÃ©ed with fresh methi (fenugreek greens), turmeric, and chili.
   * Earthy, slightly bitter, very authentic.

---

### Person C (Extras / accompaniments)

5. **Sambar (Tamarind Lentil Stew)**

   * Toor dal with tamarind, sambar masala, and veggies (like drumstick, okra, or carrots).
   * A tangy, soupy dish from the South, contrasts nicely with North Indian curries.

6. **Mint-Coriander Chutney + Lemon Rice**

   * Chutney: fresh mint, coriander, green chili, lime, ginger. Bright and cooling.
   * Lemon rice: basmati with lemon juice, curry leaves, green chili, and a turmeric kick.

---

ðŸ‘‰ This second spread gives:

* **2 curries** (rajma, korma)
* **2 dry sabzis** (cabbage thoran, methi aloo)
* **1 dal/stew + rice** (sambar + lemon rice)
* **1 chutney**

So youâ€™ve now got two full menus: one more **North Indianâ€“leaning** (first list) and one with **a South Indian mix** (second list). Both are vegan, varied, and not overlapping.

---

Want me to also suggest a couple of **snack/starters** (like pakoras or samosas) in case you want to open the dinner with finger food?

---

Great ðŸ™‚ here are a few **vegan-friendly Indian starters/snacks** you can add before the main meal:

---

### Light / Finger Food Options

1. **Vegetable Pakoras**

   * Mixed veg (onion, potato, spinach, cauliflower) dipped in spiced chickpea flour batter, deep-fried till crisp.
   * Classic street snack, serve with chutneys.

2. **Samosas (with potatoâ€“pea filling)**

   * Spiced mashed potato and peas in pastry triangles.
   * Can be baked or fried, serve with tamarind chutney.

3. **Bhel Puri (puffed rice salad)**

   * Puffed rice mixed with tomato, onion, cucumber, coriander, green chili, chutneys.
   * Light, crunchy, tangyâ€”no cooking needed beyond prep.

---

### Hot & Shareable

4. **Onion Bhajis**

   * Sliced onion with chickpea flour, turmeric, chili, corianderâ€”deep-fried into fritters.
   * Serve with mint chutney.

5. **Hara Bhara Kababs**

   * Spinach, peas, and potato patties spiced with garam masala and chili.
   * Shallow-fry or bake; good with green chutney.

---

### Cooling Sides (nice before or alongside mains)

6. **Kachumber Salad**

   * Finely diced cucumber, tomato, onion, coriander, lemon juice.
   * Fresh palate cleanser.

7. **Pineapple or Mango Chutney**

   * Sweet-sour fruit chutney cooked down with chili, ginger, and spices.
   * Lovely contrast with savory starters.

---

ðŸ‘‰ If you just want **one or two** to add without overloading the menu, Iâ€™d suggest:

* **Pakoras** (easy, crowd-pleaser)
* **Kachumber Salad** (fresh balance)

Would you like me to write out **detailed recipes for pakoras + chutney**, since theyâ€™re almost always a hit at Indian-themed dinners?
